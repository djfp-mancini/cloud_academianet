 Academia Net is a review network sponsored by the University of Ontario Institute of Technology on Oshawa, Ontario, Canada for members of the academic community to come together and write their reviews of various conferences being held and journals that have been published in the academic community, or add their own if it is not in the database. Using the Ionic Framework hosted on Google Cloud as a frontend, and Firebase as a backend, we have been able to create a unique and reliable software that allows members of the global academic community to come together to share their experiences with their contemporaries.
